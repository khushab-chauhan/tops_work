What is an API ?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to communicate with each other.
API is like a waiter in a restaurant — it takes your request (order), tells the kitchen (server) what you want, and brings back the response (food).

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract or interface that defines how two software components should interact with each other.

In software architecture, APIs abstract internal logic, allowing systems to communicate without knowing each other’s internal details.

2.Types of APIs: REST, SOAP.
REST is a lightweight architectural style used to design networked applications, typically over HTTP.
 1. REST API (Representational State Transfer)
Overview:
REST is a lightweight architectural style used to design networked applications, typically over HTTP.
 2. SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol)
Overview:
SOAP is a protocol-based API that uses XML for communication and has strict rules.
It was widely used before REST became popular.



3.Why are APIs important in web development?

communication bridge=>	Connects frontend & backend
Integration with third-party=>	Adds external features (maps, payments, etc.)
Reusability=>	Share logic across systems (mobile/web)
Scalability=>	Supports large-scale apps via microservices
Security=>	API keys, tokens protect endpoints
Automation=>	Triggers and workflows based on API responses
