1.Defining URLs and linking them to views.
In Django and DRF, URLs act as the entry point for your API. You define routes (URLs) and link them to views that handle the logic for that request.
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response


@api_view(['GET'])
def hello_api(request):
    return Response({"message": "Hello from API!"})
from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_api


urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', hello_api),  # URL: /hello/
]
