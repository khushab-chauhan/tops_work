1.Understanding project requirements.
It means clearly knowing what the project should do, how it should behave, what features it must include, and what the client or user expects.

1. Read the Requirement Document Carefully
Identify keywords, features, constraints, and deliverables.

Ask: What is being asked to build? What are must-haves?

2. Break it Down into Smaller Parts
Convert requirements into a list of features or modules.

Example:

Login module

Dashboard module

Billing form

Generate invoice

3. Ask Clarifying Questions
If anything is unclear, ask the client or team.
Questions can include:

“Should the invoice be printable?”

“Should we allow multiple users?”

“Should it support mobile view?”

4. Visualize the System (Draw Diagrams)
Draw UI sketches, ER diagrams, flowcharts, or UML to understand:

What users will see

How data flows

What modules are needed

5. Understand Constraints
Time limit

Tech stack (e.g., must use Tkinter and MySQL)

Deployment method (e.g., must work on local machine)

6. Document Your Understanding
Write a short document with:

Summary of what the system will do

List of features

Tools/libraries to be used

File/module structure (rough plan)

7. Get Feedback Before Starting
Show your understanding to your mentor, client, or instructor.

Get confirmation so that you’re building the right thing.
