1. Adding pagination to APIs to handle large data sets. 

Pagination in Django REST Framework (DRF) is a method used to split large data sets into smaller chunks (pages) when returning data from an API. This helps improve:

Performance (faster API responses)

User experience (less data to load/render)

Network efficiency (smaller payloads)
