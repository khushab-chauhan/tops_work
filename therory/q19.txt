1.  Using email sending APIs like SendGrid and Mailchimp to send transactional emails.


Email sending APIs are web services that allow developers to send emails programmatically (via code) instead of relying on local email servers.

These APIs are ideal for sending:

Transactional emails (password resets, confirmations)

Marketing emails (newsletters, promotions)

Verification emails (OTP, signup links)
