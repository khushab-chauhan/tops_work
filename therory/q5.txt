1.Understanding views in DRF: Function-based views vs Class-based views.

Function-Based Views are simple Python functions that take a request object and return a Response. DRF provides the @api_view decorator to turn a regular Django view into an API view.
Characteristics:
Simple to write and understand

Logic for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) is handled inside a single function

Best suited for small or quick APIs

Class-Based Views use Python classes to structure the view logic. DRF provides powerful base classes like APIView, GenericAPIView, and ViewSet to support reusable and scalable API design.

Characteristics:
Each HTTP method is defined as a separate method (get(), post(), etc.)

Encourages object-oriented principles like inheritance and mixins

More scalable and reusable

Preferred for large or complex APIs
